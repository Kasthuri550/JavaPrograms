### **Brute Force Approach (Using `BinaryIteratorBrute`)**

#### **Time Complexity (TC):**
1. **Inorder Traversal:**  
   - During the constructor call, the entire tree is traversed in-order, which takes \( O(N) \), where \( N \) is the number of nodes in the tree.

2. **`next()` Method:**  
   - Simply retrieves the next element from the precomputed list in \( O(1) \).

3. **`hasNext()` Method:**  
   - Compares the current index with the size of the list in \( O(1) \).

**Overall Time Complexity:**  
\[
O(N) \, \text{(for constructor)} \, + \, O(1) \, \text{(per operation)}
\]

---

#### **Space Complexity (SC):**
1. **Storage for Inorder Traversal:**  
   - Requires \( O(N) \) space to store all nodes in sorted order.

2. **No Additional Space for Stack:**  
   - No stack is maintained during traversal as it is done recursively.

**Overall Space Complexity:**  
\[
O(N)
\]

### **Better Approach (Using `BinaryIteratorBetter`)**

#### **Time Complexity (TC):**
1. **Pushing Left Nodes to Stack (`pushAllLeft`):**  
   - In the constructor, leftmost nodes are pushed to the stack. For a balanced BST, this takes \( O(\log N) \), and for a skewed BST, this takes \( O(N) \).  

2. **`next()` Method:**  
   - Each call to `next()` involves popping a node from the stack and possibly processing its right subtree.  
   - Total nodes processed is \( N \), with each node being pushed and popped exactly once.  
   - Overall time for \( N \) calls: \( O(N) \).

3. **`hasNext()` Method:**  
   - Checking if the stack is empty takes \( O(1) \).

**Overall Time Complexity:**  
\[
O(1) \, \text{(per operation)} \, \text{and} \, O(N) \, \text{for all operations combined.}
\]

---

#### **Space Complexity (SC):**
1. **Stack Storage:**  
   - At most \( O(H) \) space is required to store nodes in the stack, where \( H \) is the height of the tree.  
   - For a balanced BST: \( H = \log N \).  
   - For a skewed BST: \( H = N \).

2. **No Additional Space for Node Storage:**  
   - Unlike the brute force approach, no extra space is required to store all node values.

**Overall Space Complexity:**  
\[
O(H) \, \text{(where \( H \) is the tree height)}
\]  
Balanced: \( O(\log N) \), Skewed: \( O(N) \).
